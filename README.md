# 1brc

This was my attempt at the 1 billion row challenge. It was a great experiance and I highly reccomend you give it a shot. 

## Timeline
Because there are multiple file I think its important you know the timeline of progress:
    -`base_line.cpp`
    -`mapped_memory.cpp`
    -`custom_table.cpp`
    -`multithreaded.cpp`
Each one got progressivly faster with the final landing at ~1.2 seconds on my machine.

## Running 
I compiled the file using `clang++ -O3 file.cpp -o file` so nothing complicated just do that and run it and you will be good to go.


## Cont.
I expect I will come back time to time to see how I can improve the code as my knowledge expands but as of right now it is a good saving point.
